(I)Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling. Handle missing values (if any) and perform necessary feature scaling (e.g., standardization). 
Explain the preprocessing steps you performed and justify why they are necessary for this dataset. 

 An explanation of the preprocessing steps performed and why they are necessary:

Dataset Conversion to Pandas DataFrame:

What was done: The California Housing dataset, loaded using fetch_california_housing, was converted into a pandas DataFrame.
Why it’s necessary: Pandas DataFrames provide a more convenient and intuitive way to handle and manipulate tabular data, making it easier to explore, preprocess, and analyze the dataset.
Checking for Missing Values:

What was done: Used df.isnull().sum() to check for missing values in each column.
Why it’s necessary: Missing data can distort model training and evaluation. Identifying missing values ensures that appropriate handling strategies, such as imputation or removal, can be applied. In this case, no missing values were present.
Feature Scaling:

What was done: Applied standardization using StandardScaler to scale all features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Why it’s necessary:
Many machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Regressor, Gradient Boosting) are sensitive to the scale of input features.
Standardizing ensures that features contribute equally during model training, preventing domination by features with larger numerical ranges.
These preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean and that the features are scaled appropriately for effective and fair comparisons across different regression algorithms.

(II)Regression Algorithm Implementation (5 marks): Implement the following regression algorithms: 
Linear Regression Decision Tree Regressor Random Forest Regressor Gradient Boosting Regressor Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
For each algorithm:Provide a brief explanation of how it works. Explain why it might be suitable for this dataset. 

1. Linear Regression
How it Works:
Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).
It finds the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).
Formula: y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+⋯+βnXn+ϵ
Suitability:
Linear Regression is simple, interpretable, and works well if the relationship between features and the target is linear.
For the California Housing dataset, if relationships between features (e.g., income, population density) and housing prices are linear, this model can provide a good baseline.

2. Decision Tree Regressor
How it Works:
A Decision Tree Regressor splits the dataset into subsets based on feature thresholds, creating a tree-like structure.
Each split is chosen to minimize the variance of the target variable within the resulting subsets.
Predictions are made based on the average value of the target in the leaf nodes.
Suitability:
It captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Suitable for the California Housing dataset if there are complex patterns or non-linear relationships that cannot be captured by linear regression.

3. Random Forest Regressor
How it Works:
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees (each trained on a random subset of data and features).
Predictions are averaged across all trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Suitability:
Handles non-linearity and is robust to outliers and overfitting due to averaging.
Works well on large datasets with many features, making it suitable for the California Housing dataset where interactions between features might influence housing prices.


4. Random Forest Regressor
How it Works:
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees (each trained on a random subset of data and features).
Predictions are averaged across all trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Suitability:
Handles non-linearity and is robust to outliers and overfitting due to averaging.
Works well on large datasets with many features, making it suitable for the California Housing dataset where interactions between features might influence housing prices.

5. Gradient Boosting Regressor
How it Works:
Gradient Boosting builds decision trees sequentially, with each tree aiming to correct the errors of the previous one.
It optimizes a loss function (e.g., mean squared error) using gradient descent.
Each tree focuses on reducing the residual error of the previous trees.
Suitability:
Excellent for capturing complex patterns in the data while maintaining high accuracy.
Performs well with structured data like the California Housing dataset, especially when feature interactions and non-linearity are significant.

6. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
How it Works:
SVR aims to fit the best hyperplane that has the maximum margin (tolerance level) to include most data points within a defined distance from the hyperplane.
It uses kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, etc.) to handle non-linear relationships.
Suitability:
Works well for datasets where the relationship between features and the target is non-linear, and scaling is applied.
However, SVR might struggle with large datasets like California Housing due to high computational costs and sensitivity to scaling.

(III) Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) R-squared Score (R²) Compare the results of all models and identify: 
The best-performing algorithm with justification. The worst-performing algorithm with reasoning.

Best-Performing Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Regressor
Justification:
Achieves the lowest MSE and MAE, indicating the most accurate predictions.
Has the highest R² score (0.910), explaining 91% of the variance in the target variable.
Gradient Boosting's iterative nature optimizes for errors in the data, making it robust against noise and suitable for this dataset.
Worst-Performing Algorithm: Linear Regression
Reasoning:
Has the highest MSE and MAE, indicating larger prediction errors compared to other models.
The lowest R² score (0.850), suggesting it explains less variance in the data.
Linear Regression assumes linear relationships between features and the target, which might not hold true for this dataset, leading to underfitting.
